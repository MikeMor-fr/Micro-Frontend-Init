# Micro-Frontend-Init

A very basci structure on how Micro-Frontends are implemented. This implementation is one amoung many others.
Each implementation way has its Pros and Cons.

Here I am using Run time Integration.

To see the project, copy the repo then in each subfolder (cart, products and container), run :
`npm install` and 
`npm run start`

The final project should available on `http://localhost:8080`
